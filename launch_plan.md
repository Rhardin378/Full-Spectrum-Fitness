# Full Spectrum Fitness — Phased Launch Plan

## Overview

Full Spectrum Fitness is a holistic wellness SaaS designed to help users understand how their mental health and physical training influence each other. The platform combines workout tracking, mental health journaling, social accountability, and AI-powered insights — built intentionally in phases to support sustainable development and real user value.

This document outlines the phased launch strategy, feature scope, and development priorities.

## Guiding Principles

- Build **real value first**, not feature overload
- Ship in **tight, testable increments**
- Keep scope realistic for a **solo developer**
- Validate user behavior before scaling AI complexity
- Prioritize **self-awareness analytics** over gamification

---

## Phase 1 — Core MVP (Proof of Value)

Validate that users care about linking mental health and workouts.
